# OTP Email Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure email functionality for OTP (One-Time Password) verification in your SGHS application.

## ðŸ“§ Gmail Configuration

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Security** â†’ **2-Step Verification**
3. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. In your Google Account settings, go to **Security** â†’ **2-Step Verification**
2. Scroll down to **App passwords**
3. Select **Mail** as the app
4. Select **Other (Custom name)** as the device
5. Enter "SGHS OTP System" as the name
6. Click **Generate**
7. Copy the generated 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file in the Backend directory:

```env
# Email Configuration for OTP
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Important:** 
- Use your actual Gmail address for `EMAIL_USER`
- Use the 16-character App Password (not your regular Gmail password) for `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- Remove spaces from the App Password when adding to .env

## ðŸš€ Testing the Setup

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd Backend
node server.js
```

### 2. Test OTP Functionality
```bash
node script/test-otp.js
```

### 3. Test with Frontend
1. Start the frontend: `npm start` (in frontend directory)
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/register
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Check your email for the OTP code
5. Complete the registration process

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid login" error**
   - Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled

2. **"Less secure app access" error**
   - This is normal with App Passwords
   - Make sure you're using the correct App Password format

3. **Email not received**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify the email address is correct
   - Wait a few minutes for delivery

4. **"Authentication failed" error**
   - Double-check the App Password
   - Ensure there are no extra spaces in the .env file
   - Restart the server after updating .env
